# Recipe Page
---


## Project Description
I made this project in order to improve my HTML and CSS.
I used the site [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm) and choose the challenge "Recipe Page".

I had to replicate the layout of the original.

This is a simple page that shows a recipe of an omelette it seperated in three sections Ingredients, Intrusctions and the Nutrition.

I feel very proud of my achievement, my replica is super similar to the original and it responds well to small devices.

I should improve my CSS organization. I feel it all over the place and it is not well organized.

## Technologies used

I used HTML and CSS to finish this challenge.
